/*“We have not succeeded in answering all our problems. The answers we have found only serve to raise a whole set of new questions. In some ways we feel we are as confused as ever, but we believe we are confused on a higher level and about more important things.”*/ — posted outside the mathematics reading room, Tromsø University

My research focuses on optimization, statistics, learning for data science, network science, and information science, including: 

- High-dimensional data analysis
- AI systems and dense networks
- Deep and machine learning
- Mathematical optimization
- High-dimensional statistics
